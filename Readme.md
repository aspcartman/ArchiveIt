# ArchiveIt
A simple backup solution.
The sole purpose is to get old stuff out of your way,
cleaning the mess but saving the directory structure.
## What does it do?
You pass in files you want to archive, the tool copies files to a server
and then creates a directory named ‘!Archive’ with symlinks to copied
files.
